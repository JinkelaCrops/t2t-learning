早在基因工程的起步阶段，能产生β-胡萝卜素的大米就被认定为具有对全世界的穷人产生最大影响的潜力。这种大米的研究一开始受到了洛克菲勒基金会(RockefellerFoundation)和欧盟(EuropeanUnion)的资助。经过10年的研究，到1999年，学术界的科学家英戈·波特里库斯(IngoPotrykus)与彼得·拜尔(PeterBeyer)终于通过把水仙和细菌DNA加入水稻基因的方式成功地产出了β-胡萝卜素。他们将专利权授予了一家农业公司，条件是该技术及其任何改进都应当免费赠予发展中国家的贫穷务农者。这家公司后来成为了先正达(Syngenta)，它保留了在发达国家的专利权，可能将其当作维生素补充剂的替代品推出。后来，先正达的研究者把水仙基因替换为玉米基因，从而改善了β-胡萝卜素的产出量。 ||| Identified in the infancy of genetic engineering as having the potential for the biggest impact for the world’s poor, beta-carotene-producing rice was initially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the European Union. In a decade of work culminating in 1999, two academic scientists, Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer, finally switched on the production of beta carotene by adding daffodil and bacteria DNA to the rice’s genome. They licensed their patent rights to the agribusiness company that later became Syngenta, on the condition that the technology and any improvements to it would be made freely available to poor farmers in the developing world. With the company retaining the right to use it in developed countries, potentially as an alternative to vitamin supplements, Syngenta scientists later improved the amount of beta carotene produced by substituting a gene from corn for the one from daffodil.

通过对市售有代表性的6种胆盐进行分析得知，6种胆盐中皆只含有胆酸（CA）、去氧胆酸（DCA）2种有效成分。CA、DCA在6种胆盐中含量差别较大。由于DCA的抑菌力比CA强得多，我们认为，目前胆盐的质控指标总胆酸含量不能真实地反映出胆盐的质量。我们建议用有效DCA含量（DCA含量+R·CA含量，R=CA抑菌力/DCA抑菌力）代替总胆酸作为胆盐的质控指标。另外，目前用于培养基生产的武汉胆盐DCA含量低且不稳定，影响抑菌力，这提示我们对胆盐的质量应予以重视。 ||| After analyzing 6 kinds of representative commercial bile salts, we drew a conclusion that all kinds of bile salts only contain two effective constituents-cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA).
