无数患者可能会从该发现中受益。这些人心肌梗死的风险较高，但又不能耐受他汀，或者摄入他汀的效果不明显。这一发现还有助于研究者进一步认识危险的低密度脂蛋白(LDL)胆固醇的作用。一些人认为，他汀类药物之所以能减少心肌梗死的风险，是因为它不仅降低了LDL水平，而且还减少了炎症。而这项新的研究表明，LDL才是关键因素，并且它的水平越低越好。 ||| The finding can help millions at high risk of heart attacks who cannot tolerate statins or do not respond to them sufficiently. And it helps clarify the role of LDL cholesterol, the dangerous form. Some had argued that statins reduced heart attack risk not just by lowering LDL levels but also by reducing inflammation.
