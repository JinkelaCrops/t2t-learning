Because the substitutes do not have cell membranes with blood-group antigens, cross matching and typing are not required before use. This saves time and facilities and allows on-the-spot transfusion. Further more, blood substitutes can be stored for more than one year, as compared with about one month for donor blood stored using standard methods. On the other hand, these first-generation blood substitutes can stay in the body's circulation only for about 20 to 30 hours (a typical red blood cell lasts about 100 days). Thus, their present role is restricted to short term applications. The basic ideas of cross-linked hemoglobin and encapsulated hemoglobin date back to the 1960s. Concentrated efforts to develop blood substitutes for public use only seriously started after 1986 because of public concerns regarding HIV) in donor blood. Had there been a serious development effort in the 1960s, blood substitutes would have already been available in 1986. As it is, the public has continued to be exposed to the potential, though extremely rare, hazard of HIV in donor blood.

Abstract: It is necessary to control the mechanical stimuli precisely in the studies of cardiac mechano-electrical feedback(MEF).In the present study a ventricular pressure-clamping system has been developed,which can be applied to isolated-perfused rabbit hearts.Controlled by a computer,this system not only can make the left ventricle follow a command defining the same pressure wave as that during a beating cycle under physiological condition,but also deliver mechanical stimuli with a proper waveform to the ventricle at a particular time phase.This system integrates multiple functions,including perfusing,pacing,recording of electrocardiogram and monophasic action potentials,and clamping and measuring of ventricular pressures in isolated-perfused hearts.Thus,it is a distinct system for investigating the phenomena and mechanisms of cardiac MEF at organ level.

Identified in the infancy of genetic engineering as having the potential for the biggest impact for the world’s poor, beta-carotene-producing rice was initially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the European Union. In a decade of work culminating in 1999, two academic scientists, Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer, finally switched on the production of beta carotene by adding daffodil and bacteria DNA to the rice’s genome. They licensed their patent rights to the agribusiness company that later became Syngenta, on the condition that the technology and any improvements to it would be made freely available to poor farmers in the developing world. With the company retaining the right to use it in developed countries, potentially as an alternative to vitamin supplements, Syngenta scientists later improved the amount of beta carotene produced by substituting a gene from corn for the one from daffodil.

After chemotherapy,the expression level of patients with Ⅲ stage of B-NHL were not significantly different from those of Ⅳ and Ⅰ/Ⅱ stage(P>0.05,respectively),but there were significant difference between Ⅰ/Ⅱ stage and Ⅳ stage(P<0.05).In the treated-patients with B-NHL,the expression levels of APRIL mRNA and protein in PD group were also significantly higher than those of CR and PR(P0.05).

The inhibitor for NO or for MMPs significantly reduced the LSEC IRI, suggesting that NO and MMPs are important mediators in the LSEC IRI.
Objective To explore the correlativity between changes of adheremce activity of erythrocyte CR1 and serum TGF-β1 levels in patients with chronic hepatic C. Methods Erythrocyte CR1 adherence activity was detected with erythrocyte immune function test and serum TGF-β1 level with ELISA in 32 patients with chronic hepatic C and compared to 35 normal healthy controls.

The presence of 11 introns in the RdRP and MP increases the efficiency of initiation of viral replication after agrobacterium-mediated delivery of the vector to leaf tissue, and therefore increase the probability of co-expression of the two viral vectors in the same cell.
